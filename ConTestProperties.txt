#Following is a sample ConTest property file. The format of the file must
#conform to the rules described in API of
#java.util.Proprties.load(InputStream).

#TARGET SPECIFICATION PROPERTIES
#================================

#Put here which classes you want ConTest to work on. Put a prefix of the fully-
#qualified class name, with slahses instead of dots:
#   targetClasses = com/ibm/myproject/
#You can also put a list of such prefixes separated by commas:
#   targetClasses = com/ibm/myproject/foo/,com/ibm/myproject/bar
#For command-line instrumentation you can leave the asterisk, and then the
#target classes will be all those you specify in the instrumentation commmand.
#See "Guidelines on how to select target classes" help page if you are not sure
#which classes to target.
targetClasses = com/jtanks/model/

#Specify files which list locations. These locations will not be targeted
#even if they are in target classes. If you have more than one file, separate
#the files with semicolons.
excludeTasks =

#Don't target locations that appear in current coverage trace files. (in
#addition to the files specified in 'excludeTasks', if any).
excludeCoveredTasks = false

#Specify a file which lists locations. Only these locations (provided they are
#within target classes) will be targeted. It's illegal to give a value here and
#in either of the two exclude options.
includeTasks =

#GENERAL PROPERTIES
#===================

#By default all output files are written to the current working directory.
#Otherwise, the output property can specify the output directory location and
#all output files will be written to that directory. In Windows, double the
#backslash (\\) to separate directories. Takes effect during both
#instrumentation and test runtime - if you do them from different working
#directories, specify an absolute directory here.
output = .

#See "Running tests" help page for more details.
#Possible values are "class", "method" and "off". If it is not "off", noise
#will begin only when a program location that corresponds to some condition is
#seen. The condition is that either the class name (if the value is "class") or
#the method name ("method") contain the string of the property beginAtValue.
beginAtType = off

   #See beginAtType. Ignored if beginAtType does not exist, is "off", or is
   #illegal. Must not be empty or contain spaces.
   beginAtValue = someString


#INSTRUMENTATION RELATED PROPERTIES
#===================================
#See "Instrumentation" help page for more details.

#Set to false to prevent the command-line instrumentation from doing backup
keepBackup = true

#Make instrumentation output to a file all locations.
writeAllTasks = false


#HEURISTIC AND NOISE RELATED PROPERTIES
#=======================================
#See "Heuristics" help page for more details.

#With this parameter (and with the 'strength') you can control the amount of
#noise ConTest does. The number gives probability to do noise at each concurrent
#event, out of 1000. 0 means never to do noise. 1000 means to do noise at all
#concurrent events. 500 - around half of the concurrent events.
#If set to 0 then noiseType, strength and haltOneThread are ignored.
noiseFrequency = 70

#If true, the various bug-finding heuristics are chosen randomly.
#The following properties are ignored in this file: noiseType, haltOneThread,
#timeoutTampering, sharedVarNoise, shared, collectShared, nonVarNoise.
#Set to false to cause this properties to be taken from this file.
#If this property is missing, it is taken to be true! Therefore, to enable
#setting heuristics manually, set it explicitly to "false".
#If replay points to a URL (next run should be a replay of a previous run),
#this property is ignored.
random = true

#Determines the type of noise primitive ConTest uses. Possible values
#are: "yields", "sleeps", "waits", "synchYields" and "mixed".
#Ignored (and randomly chosen) if random = true
noiseType = yields

#When noise is done (see 'noiseFrequency'), this property controls HOW MUCH is
#done - the strength of one "noise unit". The exact meaning of the number
#depends on the mode (see property "noiseType"). Should be 0 and above, or -1 to
#tell ConTest to choose the default value for the chosen noiseType.
strength = -1

#This is a heuristic that occasionally stops one thread for as long as possible.
#Set to true to activate it.
#Ignored (and randomly chosen) if random = true. Ignored (and disabled) if
#frequency is 0. Can work with strength 0.
haltOneThread = false

#If this property is true, ConTest randomly reduces the timeout parameter given
#to the methods Thread.sleep, Thread.join and Object.wait. See "heuristic" help
#page for explanation why this is good. To cancel this behavior, set to false.
#Ignored (and randomly chosen) if random = true
timeoutTampering = true

#If true, noise is concentrated on accesses to shared variables. Dependant
#properties: shared, collectShared, nonVarNoise.
#Ignored (and randomly chosen) if random = true
sharedVarNoise = true

   #This property is relevant if and only if sharedVarNoise is true and random
   #is false. Possible values: "all", "one". If "all", the noise will be made on
   #all detected shared variables. If "one", only one variable will be selected.
   #It will be randomly selected from the initial contents of the shared vars
   #file. If the file is initially empty or does not exist, noise will be made
   #on all detected shared vars (as if it was "all").
   shared = all

   #This property is relevant if and only if sharedVarNoise is true and random
   #is false. If true, new shared vars are identified and added to the set. If
   #false, only those originally in the file are taken. However, if the file
   #initially does not exist or is empty, it is taken to be true regardless of
   #the value written here.
   collectShared = true

   #This property is relevant if and only if sharedVarNoise is true and random
   #is false. It involves concurrent events that are not read/write to variables
   #(e.g., synchronization primitives). If it is true, noise will be done on
   #such events (in addition to shared variables).
   nonVarNoise = true


#DEBUGGING AID PROPERTIES
#=========================
#See "Debugging Aids" help page for more details.

#Set to true to enable lock status report.
lockStatus = false

#Set to true to enable thread-last-location report.
threadLocation = false

#Set to true to enable "orange-box" reports.
orange_box = false

   #Set the number of desired values per variable in "orange-box" report.
   last_values_size = 2

   #Set to false to make the orange box keep info for objects which may already
   #be reclaimed by the garabage collector, and prevent their reclaiming.
   forgetting_orange_box = true

#Controls the Partial Replay feature - see "Debugging Aids" help page. Possible
#values: false (no replay), true (record next run), or the ID of the run to be
#replayed.
replay = false

#Set to true to enable the lock actions trace.
lockHistory = false


#FAULT DETECTION PROPERTIES
#===========================
#See "Lock Discipline" help page for more details.

#Set to true to enable lock discipline trace.
lockDiscipline = false


#COVERAGE PROPERTIES
#====================
#See "Coverage" help page for more details.

#Coverage of program locations of method entry. It effectively gives coverage
#of methods. To use it, set it to true, and make sure the appropriate flag was
#set in instrumentation.
methodCoverage = false

#Coverage of bytecode basic blocks. Effectively gives coverage of statements.
#To use it, set it to true, and make sure the appropriate flag was set in
#instrumentation.
basicBlockCoverage = false

#Concurrent coverage, which checks that each synchronization block indeed
#blocked at least once waiting for the lock.
synchronizationCoverage = false

#Coverage of the shared variables detected in this run.
sharedVarCoverage = false

#Lists pairs of concurrent event program locations that appeared consecutively
#in a run, and whether or not they were performed by the same thread (i.e
#whether there was context switch).
concurrentEventPairsCoverage = false

#A directory, or a list of directories separated by semicolons, under which
#source files are searched (recursively). By default, current working directory
#is searched. Leave empty to not include source directory at all in locations.
#Takes effect during instrumentation.
sourceDirs = .

#Buffer size of the coverage output streams. Applies to method, basic block
#and pairs coverage. Value smaller than 256 is ignored; the buffer is flushed
#after each task.
buffer_size = 0


#CALLBACK PROPERTIES
#====================
#See "Callback thread" help page for more details.

#If true, starts a callback thread that gets input from standard input
#(keyboard). See "Callback Thread" help page.
enable_keyboard_callback = false

#If true, starts a callback thread that gets input from network port. Related
#property: callback_port_number. See "Callback Thread" help page.
enable_port_callback = false

   #if enable_port_callback is true, this property determines the port number on
   #which the server (contest) will listen for connection requests. If it is
   #left 0, the operating system will choose an available port. It will be
   #announced as a contest verbose print (so you'll probably want to have
   #verbose on in this case).
   callback_port_number = 0


#DATAGRAM FAULT INJECTION PROPERTIES
#====================================
#See "Datagram Fault Injection" help page for more details.

#Possible values are: "disabled", "no-noise", "delay", "block",
#"random-conservative" and "random-radical". See "fault injection: datagram"
#help page.
datagramFaultInjectionMode = random-conservative

#Possible values are: "incoming", "outgoing", "both" (default). See "fault
#injection: datagram" help page.
datagramFaultInjectionDirection = both

#A number between 0 and 1000: Probability (out of 1000) to interfere with each
#package. See "fault injection: datagram" help page.
datagramFaultInjectionFrequency = 100

#An upper bound on the buffer length of packets that may take part in reordering
#of datagram fault injection. See "fault injection: datagram" help page.
