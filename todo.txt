This is a list of things we would like to do with JTanks.

Add findbugs, testability explorer
Put score in tanks.
Split into packages for model [Tank, GameState], view [ArenaDisplay, ScoreBoard], and controller [Arena, Scorer].
Rebuild all jtanks and jtanks.util classes using TDD.
Allow arbitrary number of tanks.
Allow arbitrary arena size.
Make it easy to build unit tests for drivers, without a mocking library.
  - For example, you should be able to install a TestRadar in a Tank,
    and easily set this Radar to report whatever you want to the driver.
Eliminate Eclipse dependency.
Provide installation instructions.
Provide usage instructions (how to run a dojo using JTanks).
Provide pluggable modules to enforce rules at startup:
  - Modules can include unit-test coverage, checkstyle, Law of Demeter,
    Extreme OO, and so on.
  - Modules can give noncompliant tanks a penalty or eliminate entirely.
